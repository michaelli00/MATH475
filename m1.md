Bijection between set of weak compositions of $[n]$ into $k$ parts AND $n$-element multisets over a $k$-eleement set

Partition $[4]$ into $3$ blocks, requires one doubleton and 2 singletons $\implies \displaystyle {4 \choose 2} = 6$ possible ways

- If blocks are distinct, we can permute them $k!$ ways

Partitions of $n$
